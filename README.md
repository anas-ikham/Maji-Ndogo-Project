# The Maji Ndogo Water Crisis Project
​The Maji Ndogo Water Crisis Project is a comprehensive data analysis initiative aimed at understanding and addressing water quality and access issues in the rural region of Maji Ndogo. The project is divided into four parts:

### Data Exploration and Cleaning: 
The first phase involved exploring the dataset, cleaning the data, and understanding its structure. Key activities included identifying data types, handling missing values, and performing basic statistical analysis.

### Clustering Analysis: 
In the second phase, advanced data techniques were used to segment water sources based on contamination levels, usage patterns, and other critical factors. This clustering revealed distinct patterns and helped prioritize areas needing immediate attention.

### Narrative Construction: 
The third phase involved weaving a comprehensive narrative from the clustered data. Key themes such as public health risks, access inequality, and infrastructural challenges were identified and illustrated using data visualization techniques.

### Recommendations and Action Plans: 
The final phase focused on developing actionable recommendations to address the water crisis, including immediate interventions and long-term strategies for sustainable water management.


## Key Skills Demonstrated:

- Data cleaning and preparation

- SQL for data querying and manipulation

- Clustering and data segmentation

- Data visualization and narrative construction (Google Sheets)

- Problem-solving and strategic planning

## Summary report:
### Insights:
Ok, so let's sum up the data we have.
 A couple of weeks ago we found some interesting insights:
 1. Most water sources are rural in Maji Ndogo.
 2. 43% of our people are using shared taps. 2000 people often share one tap.
 3. 31% of our population has water infrastructure in their homes, but within that group,
 4. 45% face non-functional systems due to issues with pipes, pumps, and reservoirs. Towns like Amina, the rural parts of Amanzi, 
	and a couple of towns across Akatsi and Hawassa have broken infrastructure.
 5. 18% of our people are using wells of which, but within that, only 28% are clean. These are mostly in Hawassa, Kilimani and Akatsi.
 6. Our citizens often face long wait times for water, averaging more than 120 minutes:
	• Queues are very long on Saturdays.
	• Queues are longer in the mornings and evenings.
	• Wednesdays and Sundays have the shortest queues.
### Practical solutions:
 1. If communities are using rivers, we will dispatch trucks to those regions to provide water temporarily in the short term, while we send out
 crews to drill for wells, providing a more permanent solution. Sokoto is the first province we will target.
 2. If communities are using wells, we will install filters to purify the water. For chemically polluted wells, we can install reverse osmosis (RO)
 filters, and for wells with biological contamination, we can install UV filters that kill microorganisms- but we should install RO filters too. In
 the long term, we must figure out why these sources are polluted.
 3. For shared taps, in the short term, we can send additional water tankers to the busiest taps, on the busiest days. We can use the queue time
 pivot table we made to send tankers at the busiest times. Meanwhile, we can start the work on installing extra taps where they are needed.
 According to UN standards, the maximum acceptable wait time for water is 30 minutes. With this in mind, our aim is to install taps to get
 queue times below 30 min. Towns like Bello, Abidjan and Zuri have a lot of people using shared taps, so we will send out teams to those
 towns first.
 4. Shared taps with short queue times (< 30 min) represent a logistical challenge to further reduce waiting times. The most effective solution,
 installing taps in homes, is resource-intensive and better suited as a long-term goal.
 5. Addressing broken infrastructure offers a significant impact even with just a single intervention. It is expensive to fix, but so many people can
 benefit from repairing one facility. For example, fixing a reservoir or pipe that multiple taps are connected to. We identified towns like Amina,
 Lusaka, Zuri, Djenne and rural parts of Amanzi seem to be good places to start.

This project highlights a data-driven approach to tackling real-world, challenges and showcases the ability to translate complex data insights into practical solutions. It is a key addition to my portfolio, demonstrating proficiency in data analysis, critical thinking, and project management.
